# Customer Churn & Retention Analysis (Excel Project)
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn and retention patterns using Microsoft Excel. The objective is to identify key factors driving customer churn, understand customer behavior across different segments, and provide data-driven insights to help businesses improve retention strategies.<br>

The project follows a complete data analysis workflow:<br>
Raw Data → Data Cleaning → Exploratory Analysis → KPI Tracking → Dashboard Visualization

## Objectives
1) Analyze customer churn behavior and retention trends<br>
2) Identify high-risk customer segments<br>
3) Track key performance indicators (KPIs) related to churn<br>
4) Build an interactive Excel dashboard for business decision-making<br>

## Tools & Techniques Used
1) Microsoft Excel<br>
2) Data Cleaning & Transformation<br>
3) Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts<br>
4) KPIs & Slicers<br>
5) Interactive Dashboard Design

## Analytical Concepts
1) Churn Rate<br>
2) Customer Segmentation<r>
3) Retention Analysis<br>
4) Comparative Performance Analysis

## Project Structure
The Excel workbook is organized into the following sheets:<br>
1️⃣ Raw_Data<br>
Contains the original customer dataset<br>
Includes customer demographics, service details, and churn status<br>

2️⃣ Data_Cleaning<br>
Removed duplicates and handled missing values<br>
Standardized categorical values<br>
Prepared clean data for analysis<br>

3️⃣ KPI & Slicer<br>
Key metrics such as:<br>
Total Customers<br>
Churned Customers<br>
Retained Customers<br>
Churn Rate<br>
Slicers added for dynamic filtering (e.g., contract type, services)<br>

4️⃣ Pivot Analysis Sheets<br>
Multiple pivot analysis sheets were created to study churn from different perspectives:<br>
Churn by contract type<br>
Churn by services used<br>
Churn by customer tenure<r>
Churn by payment method<br>
Churn by demographic segments<br>

5️⃣ Dashboard<br>
Fully interactive dashboard<br>
Visual elements include:<br>
Bar charts<br>
Pie charts<br>
KPI cards<br>

Allows stakeholders to quickly identify:<br>
High-churn segments<br>
Retention opportunities<br>
Overall customer health<br>

## Key Insights
1) The overall customer churn rate is 49.8%, indicating that nearly half of the customer base is leaving, which represents a significant retention risk for the business.<br>
2) Customers on monthly contracts exhibit the highest churn, accounting for 129 churned customers, while two-year contracts show the lowest churn (46 customers). This highlights the strong relationship between contract duration and customer retention.<br>
3) Long-tenure customers (4+ years) also show high churn, suggesting that retention issues are not limited to new customers and may be driven by pricing, service fatigue, or competitive alternatives.<br>
4) Customers using Cash and Credit Card payment methods account for the highest share of churn (27% each), while automated payment methods such as Bank Transfer and Electronic Check show relatively lower churn.<br>
5) Customers with internet services (DSL and Fiber) experience higher churn compared to those with no internet service, implying service quality, pricing, or reliability issues.<br>
6) Short-tenure customers (0–6 months) show early churn risk, emphasizing the importance of strong onboarding and early engagement strategies.<br>
7) The analysis reveals that contract type, tenure, pricing, and payment method are the most influential factors affecting customer churn.

## Business Impact
1) This analysis helps businesses to:<br>
2) Predict potential churn risks<br>
3) Design targeted retention strategies<br>
4) Improve customer lifetime value<br>
5) Support management with visual, data-driven insights

## Skills Demonstrated
1) Data Cleaning & Preparation<br>
2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)<br>
3) KPI Development<br>
4) Dashboard & Reporting<br>
5) Business Interpretation of Data.
